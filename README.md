### Explore US Bikeshare Data

In this project, i use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. I will write code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. I will also write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

The following software requirements apply:

- Project requires Python 3, NumPy, and pandas installed using Anaconda
- A text editor, like [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/) or [Atom](https://github.blog/2022-06-08-sunsetting-atom/).
- A terminal application (Terminal on Mac and Linux or Cygwin on Windows).
